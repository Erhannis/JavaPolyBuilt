# JavaPolyBuilt
Prebuilt version of JavaPoly.
( https://www.javapoly.com/ , http://git.javadeploy.net/jimsproch/JavaPoly )
I had trouble building it, and it seems like it's inactive.  javapoly.js by default downloads many files from JavaPoly.com, so in case that site ever goes down, I've downloaded the files and put them in this repo.  I tweaked javapoly.js to pull files locally rather than javapoly.com, so put these files on the root of your site (minus the example index.html and `examples` folder), and javapoly.js shouldn't need any files from a third-party server.

This isn't mine, but the JavaPoly source license looks like the MIT license, maybe?  Plz no sue me.
